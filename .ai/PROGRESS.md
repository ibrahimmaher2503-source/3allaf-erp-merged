# UI/UX Release Progress

**Updated:** 2026-08-27
**Branch:** `feature/m50a-shell-dashboard`
**Baseline:** published `v0.1.4`

| Milestone | Status |
|---|---|
| M50A — global shell, navigation, operational dashboard | Engineering foundation committed |
| M50A.1 — visual hierarchy, density, navigation, responsive and Arabic correction | Complete in development |
| M50B.1 — internal-page foundation and Sales & POS workspace | Complete in development |

M50B.1 adds reusable active-filter chips, bounded pagination, responsive resource rows, a scoped Sales Overview, refined invoice/customer/shift pages, consistent POS entry navigation, and the v0.1.5 desktop-sidebar recovery fix.

M50A.1 changed shared presentation, centralized module-dashboard specification, and bounded read-only dashboard composition only. The operational dashboard and representative Inventory overview use existing authorized data; no route, permission, mutation workflow, schema, migration, production runtime, or deployment state changed. The single locked build passed, and genuine local rendered evidence is stored outside Git in the approved `m50a1-evidence-20260827` directory.

| M50B.2 — Purchasing & Suppliers workspace | Complete in development |
| M50B.3 — Products, Inventory & Barcodes workspace | Complete in development |
| M50B.4 — Pricing, Promotions & Discounts workspace | Complete in development |
| M50B.5 — Parties, Bookings & Customers workspace | Complete in development |

M50B.2 adds the scoped purchasing overview, seven-day trend, receiving/approval/return indicators, bounded top/recent purchasing lists, and responsive supplier/invoice/order/return tables. Due/overdue balances are omitted because there is no authoritative payable ledger.

M50B.3 wires and expands the existing scoped inventory overview with authoritative product/variant, balance, valuation, movement, exception, transfer/count/adjustment, distribution, and top-movement information. Products, balances, movements, and label queues use the shared responsive list foundation. System Settings save controls now expose exact idle/action loading states.

M50B.4 adds an authorized-store-scoped Pricing dashboard, effective/scheduled price coverage, approval and deterministic exception indicators, bounded recent activity, responsive filters/sorting/pagination, and scoped label readiness. No standalone promotion campaign model exists, so unsupported promotion metrics and margin inference are deliberately omitted. The shell now reports all authorized stores honestly instead of displaying the first visible store as an implied active context.

M50B.5 adds a visible-branch/store-scoped Party dashboard, schedule and collections indicators, seven-day booking trend, upcoming agenda, service/payment summaries, responsive booking/invoice/order queues, and Party history on the existing customer profile. Package and venue master data are not fabricated because the authoritative model currently stores service lines and booking locations directly.
